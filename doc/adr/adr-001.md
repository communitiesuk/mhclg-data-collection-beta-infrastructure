### ADR - 001: Initial Architecture Decisions

#### Infrastructure

AWS as an account is already setup from Alpha and other MHCLG services are running there also.

We want to be mindful of not being to tied in to specialist services so that if there is a need to migrate to other cloud providers in the future, it's relatively straight forward.

Other providers considered:
- Gov Pass - Simpler setup, supported maintenance but would need account creating and may have less control over database options
- Azure may need to move there if MHCLG takes the decision to move CDS there but until that happens data transfer makes AWS more practical

Infrastructure
- ECS (Elastic Container Service) - managed and relatively generic
- RDS Postgres

Accounts
- Single AWS account with a testing environment and a production environment
- Separate terraform for each environment
- All infrastructure tagged to environment
- Scoped IAM user for each environment that all infra is accessed through
- We will start with a single environment and create a second when the project requires it (this may be as soon as working on front end features)
