### ADR - 001: Initial Architecture Decisions

#### Infrastructure

AWS as an account is already setup from Alpha and other MHCLG services are running there also.

We want to be mindful of not being to tied in to specialist services so that if there is a need to migrate to other cloud providers in the future, it's relatively straight forward.

Other providers considered:
- Gov Pass - Simpler setup, supported maintenance but would need account creating and may have less control over database options
- Azure may need to move there if MHCLG takes the decision to move CDS there but until that happens data transfer makes AWS more practical

Infrastructure
- ECS (Elastic Container Service) - managed and relatively generic
- RDS Postgres

Accounts
- Single AWS account with a testing environment and a production environment
- Separate terraform for each environment
- All infrastructure tagged to environment
- Scoped IAM user for each environment that all infra is accessed through
- We will start with a single environment and create a second when the project requires it (this may be as soon as working on front end features)

#### Tech Stack

##### Application Framework

Ruby on Rails
- Well established and commonly used within MHCLG and gov.uk in general
- Good ecosystem for common web app tasks, quick productivity
- Matches team skill set
- Analysis/RAP pipelines will sit in the DAP platform and not this application directly so optimising for web framework tasks makes sense.

Testing
 - Rspec for unit testing
 - Capybara or Cypress-Rails for front end testing
 - TDD or ATDD approach
 - No specific code coverage target or deploy gate as we feel this leads to arbitrary metric chasing and is counter-productive

Front end
- In the same app codebase
- ERB templates

Code Style & Linting
- Gov.uk Rubocop for Ruby style
- .editorconfig for whitespace, newlines etc

#### Ways of Working

- Flexible approach to branching. Generally Trunk based CI (every TDD round results in a commit and push to master) when pairing, branches and PR when doing solo or more exploratory work.
- Github actions for automated test, build, deploy pipeline
- Github actions should run Rubocop, RSpec, Front end tests, docker build and deploy
- Encourage pairing
